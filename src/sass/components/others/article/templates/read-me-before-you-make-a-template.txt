You can make every template you want.

If you want to extend a template that already exist, with something more or something less - Just do like this:
  - Create a new template, called the same way of the original one
    - Example: 
      - Original template: preview-2
      - New template extended from preview-2 name: preview-2.1
  - The tokens from the original template will be extended to the new one.
  - If you need a brand new template with brand new tokens, then you need to create a new template.

  - Template names should be meaninful, but its very hard to make them like that - For now i am using numbers
